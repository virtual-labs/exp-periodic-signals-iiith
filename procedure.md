### Procedure

#### Frequency Response

This section requires selection of a system, and visualizing the frequency response of the LTI system and tweaking some parameters of the frequency response. The objective of this section is to visualize the magnitude and phase responses of some LTI systems and identify the working of the system and observe how it changes with change in cutoff frequencies. Click on the "**Check**" button to visualize the plots. Steps to be done are as follows

1. Select the system in the drop down provided in the center box
2. Enter the Parameter values as required
3. Click on Check button to visualize the plot in the figures

The parameters mentioned as "Parameter 1" and "Parameter 2" for the systems correspond to the parameters as listed below

|   System             |Parameter 1                        |Parameter 2                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Low Pass|Cutoff Frequency           |-            |
|High Pass| Cutoff Frequency |- |
|Band Pass|Lower Cutoff Frequency|Higher Cutoff Frequency|
|Band Stop|Lower Cutoff Frequency|Higher Cutoff Frequency|

The plot is obtained and it represents the magnitude and phase response of the selected system with the specified parameters.

#### LTI Systems

This section requires selection of a system, and visualizing the working of an LTI system by selecting an input signal by tweaking the filter parameters. The objective of this section is to visualize how various LTI systems work on different input signals. Click on the "**Check**" button to visualize the plots. Steps to be done are as follows

1. Select the signal in the drop down provided
2. Select the Parameters as required
3. Select the system in the drop down provided in the center box
4. Click on Check button to visualize the plot in the figure

The parameters mentioned as "Parameter 1" and "Parameter 2" for the systems correspond to the parameters as listed below

|   System             |Parameter 1                        |Parameter 2                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Low Pass|Cutoff Frequency           |-            |
|High Pass| Cutoff Frequency |- |
|Band Pass|Lower Cutoff Frequency|Higher Cutoff Frequency|
|Band Stop|Lower Cutoff Frequency|Higher Cutoff Frequency|

The plot is obtained and it represents the output of the selected LTI system when the input to the LTI system is the selected signal and plots the magnitude and phase responses using the specified parameters.

#### Quiz 1

This section is to test the understanding, and run simulations over randomly generated inputs. The objective of this section is to test the understanding of the working of an LTI System. In this section, we have an input signal, which is a sum of two sinusoids of and the output of the unknown LTI system is given. 

The task here is to identify the system which **cannot** be used for this purpose. Click on the "**Check**" button to check if the choice is right or wrong. Steps to be done are as follows

1. Select the filter in the drop down box in the centre

The observations tab at the bottom shows comments on whether the chosen system is the correct choice.

#### Quiz 2

This section is to test the understanding, get feedback and run simulations over randomly generated inputs. The objective of this section is to test the understanding of the working of an LTI System. In this section, we have an input signal, and the output of the unknown LTI system is given.

The task here is to identify a system, and provide parameters for the system which can possibly convert the given input to the given output. Click on the "**Check**" button which would be useful for feedback. Steps to be done are as follows

1. Select the system in the drop down in the centre
2. Fill the parameters as required

Please note that **multiple solutions** are possible here.
